## Classification of Papers

## iOracle

First Author           = Deshotels
Title                  = iOracle: Automated Evaluation of Access Control Policies in iOS
Venue                  = ASIA-CCS 2018
Type                   = _Audit_
Relevance              = High
Scope                  = Narrow
Feasibility/Utility    = Low
Durability of Insights = Medium
Notes                  = This work is highly relevant as it identifies vulnerable policy in one of the most widely used mobile OSes in the world. Unfortunately, its usefulness is highly specific to iOS and cannot be directly generlized to other OSes. I also give it a low score for feasibility, since it is only really useful to stakeholders who are already security experts and relies on a lot of guess-work to get around the proprietary security implementations in iOS. The insights are sort of durable, as I can imagine severak follow-up directions here.

## Analyzing and Comparing the Protection Quality of Security Enhanced Operating Systems

First Author           = Chen
Title                  = Analyzing and Comparing the Protection Quality of Security Enhanced Operating Systems
Venue                  = NDSS 2009
Type                   = _Audit_
Relevance              = High
Scope                  = Medium
Feasibility/Utility    = Medium
Durability of Insights = Medium
Notes                  = Much of the same rationale applies here. However I upgraded, scope and utility categories as this work enables the comparison of multiple popular MAC implementations in Linux, which is both a widely used and open source operating system. I can imagine a lot of follow-up work here.

## TRON

First Author           = Berman
Title                  = TRON: Process-Specific File Protection for the UNIX Operating System
Venue                  = US 1995
Type                   = Defense
Relevance              = High
Scope                  = Broad
Feasibility/Utility    = Medium
Durability of Insights = High
Notes                  = TRON was one of the first works that really looked into confining specific processes, moving beyond the coarse-grained, user-centric Unix DAC.
