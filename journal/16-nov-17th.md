## Classification of Papers

See my spreadsheet on Teams.

## Web Scraper

The webscraper is done. See https://github.com/willfindlay/ConDense

What we have:

* We have a scraper
* We have a wrangler that turns it into the spreadsheet we want
    * Including author count

What's next:

* Calculate useful stats (like what?)
    * Author count
    * Reference count
    * Area/Classification?
* Charts!
    * Author count by conference year
    * Reference count by conference by year
    * Classification ratios (Attack:Defense, etc.) by conference by year
    * Area by conference by year? (maybe)
    * etc.

## Thoughts on the Readings

### Establishing a Baseline for Measuring Advancement in theScience of Security â€“ an Analysis of the 2015 IEEESecurity & Privacy Proceedings

The focus here is on the quality of scientific reporting in security papers.

* Not so much attack vs defense
* Rather, do they present:
    * Research objectives?
    * Limitations?
    * Threats to validity?
    * Etc.

In theory, it would be nice to move towards higher quality scientific reporting
in security. But this doesn't really solve the problem of increasingly
irrelevant and impractical security literature in academia.

However, we can certainly borrow some of the ideas here (e.g. how the
paper is structured, the types of research questions, etc.).

"Five of the authors developed and evolved a rubric of indicators of scientific research based upon the literature."

* This sounds similar to the rubric we have been discussing in class
* But it seems to be much finer-grained
    * (probably closer to what we initially discussed than where we ended up)

"Six other authors applied this rubric to evaluate the 55 papers in the 2015
IEEE Security and Privacy conference proceedings."

* It seems that the scope of their study is also much narrower than our own

"Because of the opportunistic nature of much of the current security research..."

* I think this hits the nail on the head
* A new attack comes up, and everyone piles on

### Characterizing Scientific Reporting in Security Literature:An analysis of ACM CCS and IEEE S&P Papers

A criterion given here that would be nice to include in our analysis:

* "Does the paper include an artifact?" -- A nice binary question with implications for practicality

## Project Updates

Now working on eBPF containers, tentatively calling the project "cell".

How it works:

* Write a high-level policy file for your container
* Each "app" has "rights" and "restrictions"
* Policy is default-deny
* Rights grant access (can be coarse-grained or fine-grained)
* Restrictions work like a "super-deny". They revoke rights and can be coarse-grained or fine-grained
    * For example, I could give a program the "access /home" right but revoke the "access /home/photos" right

An example:

```yaml
# my_container.yml

apps:
  - /bin/myapp1
    rights:
      - ipc /bin/myapp2
      - access /home
      - network
    restrictions:
      - access /home/photos
  - /bin/myapp2
    rights:
      - ipc /bin/myapp1
      - execute /bin/myapp3
  - /bin/myapp3
```
