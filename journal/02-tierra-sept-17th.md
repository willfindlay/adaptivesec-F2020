## Random Thoughts

- Tierra puts a **strong** emphasis on *environment*
- The entire point of the design of the Tierran virtual machine and language is to create an environment that is conducive to evolution
    - Because classic Von Neumann machine languages are not meant to be "evolvable"
    - Too brittle -> very hard to pick a working program out of a random permutation of machine code instructions
- For Tierran, creating an evolvable environment for programs requires:
    - Shrinking the instruction set (to mimic natural proteins and amino acids)
    - Addressing instructions by their "templates" rather than individually, to mimic complementarity (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)) in biology
- How does this relate to (adaptive) security?
    - "Changing the game" involves creating an environment in which it no longer pays dividends to be an attacker
    - Creating software that can evolve could help add diversity to the environment (reduces the impact of finding common exploits)
    - a Tierran-like substrate might be conducive to creating evolvable programs
