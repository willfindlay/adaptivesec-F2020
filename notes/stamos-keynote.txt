Alex Stamos Election Fraud Talk
===============================

WOW! He's talking about acamedia vs industry!
    - The _disconnect between academia and reality_
    - "CS Hard Problems" vs "Practical Problems" with real-world implications
    - Who cares if you can run rowhammer attacks to mess around with VM memory
    - None of this is practical
    - We need to _incentivize_ practical academic work

trade-offs between preventing harm and respecting privacy
    - We need to see more research here

open sourcing lectures!!!
