\section{Discussion}

\todo{Write this}

\subsection{Limitations}

\todo{eBPF map size restrictions; can make the maps bigger, but too big leads to high memory consumption; a non-prealloc maps are a nice compromise, but has been known to cause deadlocks \cite{starovoitov2016_prealloc}}

\todo{Current prototype only focuses on least-privilege}

\subsection{Future Work}

\todo{New helpers for virtualization $\rightarrow$ \texttt{bpf\_enter\_namespace}, \texttt{bpf\_enter\_cgroup}, \texttt{bpf\_mountns\_remount}?}

\todo{Combine virtualization rules and least-privilege; for example create an overlay filesystem and then restrict read and write to that filesystem only. this would eliminate the need for explicit filesystem and file rules}

\todo{Inode local storage and task local storage maps in 5.10}

\todo{Add other control flow integrity features to harden the kernel}

\todo{Direct integration with existing container management systems like Docker}
