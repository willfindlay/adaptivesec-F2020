\todo{Redo this abstract when I have time}
Containers are becoming an increasingly important part of the Linux ecosystem.
Containerized package managers like Snapcraft \cite{snap} and FlatPak
\cite{flatpak} enable easy distribution and dependency management for desktop
applications, while Docker \cite{docker} and Kubernetes \cite{kubernetes}
provide a framework for scaling and composing micro-services, especially in the
cloud.  While containers offer a convenient abstraction for distributing and
configuring software, they are also often used as a light-weight alternative to
heavier virtualization techniques, such as virtual machines. Thus, containers
can also be thought of as security mechanisms, implementing a form of isolation
between processes that share the resources of the underlying operating system.

Despite this clear security use case, existing container implementations do not
consider security as a primary goal, and often fall back to insecure defaults
when the host does not support the correct security abstractions. Further,
container security implementations are often complex, relying on a myriad of
virtualization techniques and security abstractions provided by the host
operating system to isolate processes and enforce least-privilege. These
security abstractions often paradoxically require elevated permissions to use in
the first place, resulting in additional security risks when applications are
able to escape confinement.

To rectify these container security issues, I present
\bpfcontain{}\footnote{\bpfcontain{} is a working title and is subject to change in the
future.}, a novel approach to containers under the Linux kernel. \bpfcontain{} is
built from the ground up as a light-weight yet secure process confinement
solution for modern applications. Implemented in eBPF, an emerging technology
for safely extending the Linux kernel, \bpfcontain{} enforces least privilege in
containerized applications without requiring any additional privileges from the
host operating system. Policies are written in a high-level language that is
designed to be readable and modifiable by end-users without requiring
significant security expertise. In this paper, I describe \bpfcontain{}'s design and
implementation, evaluate its performance and security, and discuss how it
compares with existing container solutions.
